### Cost-Calculator

Helloüëã <br>
Welcome to practice the online calculation program.‚ù§Ô∏è<br>
In this program, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are used.<br>
The values are calculated online and the price will be shown to you.<br>
Also, the customer's name and address can be displayed in the invoice.<br>
Our goal in this program is to calculate online the cost of sending a parcel based on distance, size, volume, type of packaging and the duration of sending (custom or normal).<br>
This program is responsive and can be used in any screen size.<br>
